# "Can you draw me a picture of a pineapple?"

That was the question I asked for all of these drawings. 

The participant drew the pineapple from memory alone, without any reference. 

The participants cannot use colors and I tried to keep the stroke widths constant (not entirely enforced)

The drawings are typically from 10 seconds to 1 minute long


## Q & A:

### Q: Why are you doing this?

This is the question I get asked the most. There is a short answer and a long
answer.

The short answer is I don't really know, it started out as a request to obtain
about a dozen pineapple pictures for a mockup, but I've taken it to the extreme
and just kept going for fun.

The long answer is that I want to explore the artistic direction that it
doesn't matter which "direction / theme" you choose, as long as the magnitude
is outrageously huge it's going to be interesting. So drawing pineapples is
just an arbitrary direction I've chosen to magnify to the extreme.

Another long answer is that drawing a sketch of a pineapple is a very
interesting cognitive proccess, it involves planning which aspect of the
pineapple exists inside a person's mind, and how the person elect to render
these features. 

All in all I believe someone would find these collections useful, either for
art or as a dataset for science / engineering.

### Q: Can I use this dataset anyway I want?

Yes. Go nuts.

### Q: Did you collect any other statistics like demographics and race / gender?

No. I feel there is definitely an interesting analysis in that direction but it
would dilute the focus of this work, which is to collect for the sake of
collect, until the collection becomes huge enough to be interesting. As soon
as I collect these "secondary" datas, there would be the inevitable question of 
"but why didn't you collect these other secondary data like how big is their hand
as well?" So I thought to avoid that altogether.

I have tried to vary my sources as to include multiple demographics for the
sake for an interesting collection though. People of different colors, ages,
and genders, from different countries were asked to participate.

### Q: What's a typical collection interaction like?

I try to find people who look like they have the free time, and I ask my
question. I have had to explain in English, Chinese, and Spanish on occasions
to get the message across, it was fun!  I gave them my phone to draw on and
after they draw the pineapple I offer them to see the other pineapples from
other participants. I reassure them that their drawing is statistically
unlikely to be the best or the worst, but I loved it all the same.

Often they would ask if it is an experiment or a survey or a study, I usually
play along and ask them "So what kind of survey do you think it is?" and continue on
anyways. It seems like people have a hard time believing I am literally just collecting
for the sake of it rather than using it for some advanced computer vision or psychological
tests :D
